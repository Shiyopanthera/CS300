# CS300

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The given scenario was to create software for the academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU that could display the courses available and their prerequisites. In Project One, I created a pseudocode for the software that met their needs and provided an analysis. In Project Two, I turned the pseudocode into C++ code to create a working application. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Throughout this course, we learned about different forms of data structures. In my Project One analysis I had to decide which formats were best suited for the application and provide reasoning. In Project Two, I decided to implement the application using a Hash Table structure. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
My coding knowledge isn't strong, so I had to refer to zyBooks and provided resources often. Through trial and error, I eventually got to the end product. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The pseudocode is extremely important. I made many adjustments as my understanding and knowledge expanded. It helped me greatly when creating the final code.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In-code comments helped me stay on track and referring to the pseudocode helped me maintain the end goals of what I wanted to accomplish.
